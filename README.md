# QuickTip- COM 437 Term project
##Project Description
Tipping has always been a topic of interest when going out with friends, dates or, colleagues. Some tip too much, some tip too little and some don't tip all. This is mostly because most people don't want to deal with math while out trying to enjoy themselves.
##Problem Addressing
My application with be addressing the anxiety around tipping after a dinner. By some tipping can be a representation of someone's respect for service personnel and by others as being finacially irresponsible. I decided to create a simple a useful application to potentially solve both of these ideas.
##Platform
I will be using Andriod Studio to create my application. I will also be using GIT and GitHub to assist with the changes to my application.
##Frontend/ Backend Support
I will bbe using XML for my front-end and Kotlin for back-end
